Our campaign #OurLives is extending the opportunity to individuals who would like to create a tribute and help support #BlackLivesMatter. A donation to #BlackLivesMatter will be made in honor of Trayvon Martin , Castro and many others. The Our Lives matter campaign will aid in the building of the OurLives matter logo and monument. The monument will host a number of tributes presented on the letters of #OUR LIVES. If you would like to join the movement? Click here!!
